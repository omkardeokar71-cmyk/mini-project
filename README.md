1)what is cybersecurity?
Cybersecurity means protecting computers, networks, and data from attacks.
Just like we lock our home to keep thieves out, cybersecurity protects our digital world from hackers.


2)CIA Triad
The CIA Triad is the foundation of cybersecurity. It has three parts:

a) Confidentiality
Keeping information secret and only allowing the right people to see it.
Example: Your password should only be known to you.

b) Integrity
Making sure information is correct and not changed by someone without permission.
Example: No one should be able to change your bank balance.

c) Availability
Making sure systems and data are available whenever needed.
Example: A website should stay online and not crash.


3)Common Types of Cyber Attacks
a) Phishing
A fake message (email/SMS) that tries to trick you into sharing passwords or bank details.

b) Malware
Software created to harm your system, like viruses, trojans, or ransomware.

c) SQL Injection
An attacker types harmful code into a website input box to steal or change data in the database.

d) XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)
An attacker injects malicious scripts into a website to steal cookies or user data.

e) Brute Force Attack
Trying many passwords again and again until the right one works.


4)Basic Cybersecurity Terms

Vulnerability
A weakness in a system that hackers can use to attack.

Threat
Anything that can cause harm.
Example: A hacker, virus, or phishing email.

Exploit
A technique used to take advantage of a vulnerability.

Payload
The actual harmful part of an attack (like a virus delivered after an exploit).

Penetration Testing
Ethical hacking to find and fix weaknesses before real hackers attack.


5)Cybersecurity Domains
Network Security
Protecting networks (WiFi, routers, servers) from attacks.

Web Application Security
Protecting websites from attacks like SQL injection and XSS.

Cloud Security
Protecting cloud data stored on platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, etc.

Digital Forensics
Investigating cybercrimes and recovering evidence.

Red Team / Blue Team
Red Team: Attackers (ethical hackers)
Blue Team: Defenders (security team who protects systems)
